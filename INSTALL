GETTING XBLAST

 use the Download links on http://xblast.sf.net/

 o  get source package xblast, if you want to compile yourself

 o  for win you can alternatively get a pre-compiled binary

 o  get data packages images, levels, models

 o  optionally get sound packages sounds and musics


PREPARING SOURCES

 o  extract the packages in some temporary directory

 o  create xblast directory if necessary

 o  place win binary in xblast, if you downloaded it

 o  move images dir to xblast/image

 o  move levels dir to xblast/level

 o  move models dir to xblast/image/sprite

 o  move sounds dir to xblast/sounds, if you have it

 o  move content of musics dir to xblast/sounds, if you have it


COMPILING THE BINARY

 Linux/Cygwin

 o change into xblast dir

 o run 'autogen.sh' to create config.h

 o run 'configure' with appropriate options

    o for public installation (requires root)
	(will install binaries in /usr/games/bin and 
	 data into /usr/share/games/XBlast-TNT)

      --prefix=/usr/games --enable-admin

    o for sound

      --enable-sound

    o for half-sized window

      --enable-mini

    o for 16-player support

      --enable-SMPF

    o if you want that data go to a different path then
    $prefix/share/games/XBlast-TNT

      --with-otherdatadir=mydir

Examples:

Private install:

	configure 

Root install with mini, SMPF, sound, data in /usr/local/share/xblast and with
xblast and xbsndsrv in /usr/bin:

	configure --enable-admin --enable-sound --enable-SMPF --enable-mini \
	--prefix=/usr --with-otherdatadir=/usr/local/share/xblast

 o run 'make' to create the binary

 o run 'make install' for public install (requires root)

 o move xblast dir where you want it, for private install


 Cygwin (alternative)

 o change into xblast dir

 o uncomment CYGWIN vars for binary independent of cygwin1.dll (requires mingw)

 o run 'make -f Makefile.windows' to create the binary

 o move xblast dir where you want it
