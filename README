I will put in my buglist :)

3.1 No Sound
If you are in Linux:
 PATH=.:$PATH ./xblast
xblast starts xbsndsrv normally when not installed (make install) from
./ so it should be in your PATH. Export it (export PATH=$PATH:.; put it in your
.bashrc or .profile for not more needing it) if you want only ./xblast.


4. Central

Atm there is no webpage to check central games...
but if you want to play a central game:
1. step(optinal):
Register your player!
In options, player, your player!
Your registration number is saved under 
.xblast_tnt/config/player.cfg . Keep it if you change
the account, computer, harddisk.  
2. step:
Join network game, join central game.
Maybe you should open your firewall to play central games.

To host a game:
open your firewall, if you got one.
create network game, rated game option (yes)(optional), then click continue,
then visible in central (server options). and then in the next
step wait for people(bots) to join your server.
